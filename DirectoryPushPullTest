Testing to see if files out side of qaGitPrac directory will be used in the push pulls


$ git push
fatal: The current branch hotFixJoe has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin hotFixJoe (i used "F" instead of "f" aswell)



$ git push --set-upstream origin hotfixJoe (used for the first push to a branch)

Had to use the following code in order to commit this .txt file so that it could be pushed
    $ git add DirectoryPushPullTest
